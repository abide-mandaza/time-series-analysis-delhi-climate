# Time Series Analysis for Daily Delhi Climate

## Overview
This project performs comprehensive time series analysis on the Daily Delhi Climate dataset to explore trends, seasonality, and temporal dependencies, and to build forecasting models for temperature data.

The analysis focuses on extracting meaningful insights from climate variables and applying classical time series models for prediction.

## Dataset
1. Daily Delhi Climate dataset
2. Variables analyzed:
   1. Mean Temperature
   2. Humidity
   3. Wind Speed
   4. Mean Pressure

## Key Tasks & Methods
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Time series visualization and seasonal analysis
3. Additive and multiplicative time series decomposition
4. Stationarity testing using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
5. Lag analysis using AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF)
6. Outlier handling using IQR-based capping
7. Time series modeling:
   1. AR (AutoRegressive)
   2. MA (Moving Average)
   3. ARMA
   4. ARIMA
   5. SARIMA
   6. SARIMAX

## Evaluation
1. Models evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
2. Comparison of classical forecasting approaches

## Tools & Technologies
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Statsmodels
7. Scikit-learn

## Results
The analysis highlights strong seasonal patterns in Delhi’s climate data and demonstrates how classical time series models can be applied to forecast temperature trends effectively.
